# Delivery Drone Route Optimization using Genetic Algorithm

This project is a Python-based system that optimizes delivery routes for drones using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The goal is to minimize delivery time and energy consumption by finding the most efficient route for a set of delivery points.

## üöÄ Features
- **Genetic Algorithm-based Optimization**: Finds the optimal route for delivery drones.
- **RESTful API**: Accepts delivery points and returns the optimized route.
- **CORS Enabled**: Allows integration with frontend applications.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Configure population size, mutation rate, and number of generations.
- **Scalable**: Designed to handle real-time route optimization.
